Read All About It Orchids: An Origin Story Inspired by all the orchidaceous opulence in our stores, we took a trip up the California coast to visit one of our long-time growing partners, a family-run operation with deep roots in the Orchid industry. There, we learned all about the life cycle of these pulchritudinous perennials and witnessed some truly dazzling displays of color—and lucky for you, we had our cameras in tow!
